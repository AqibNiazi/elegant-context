# Elegant Context

Elegant Context is a practice project where I explore global state management in **React 19** using **useContext** and **useReducer** hooks. This project implements a simple dashboard with a cart system, allowing users to add, increase, and decrease cart items dynamically.

## 🚀 Features
- Global state management using **useContext** and **useReducer**.
- **Add to Cart** functionality.
- **Cart Modal** displaying added items.
- **Increase & Decrease Quantity** of cart items.
- Modern **React 19** best practices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React 19**
- **useContext** & **useReducer** hooks
- **Vite** (for fast development)
- **CSS** (for styling)

## 📂 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AqibNiazi/elegant-context.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd elegant-context
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The project will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port assigned by Vite).

## 🛒 How It Works
1. Click the **Add to Cart** button to add an item.
2. Open the **Cart Modal** to view selected items.
3. Use **+ (increase)** or **- (decrease)** buttons to update quantities.
4. The global state ensures consistent data management.
